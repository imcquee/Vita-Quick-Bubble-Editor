# Vita Quick Bubble Editor

This is a simple homebrew for the vita that allows you to quickly edit a bubbles name or temporarily delete it (will come back upon a database rebuild)

**Note**: While this program should not corrupt the system database in any way, as a precautionary measure it will save the app.db before commiting the change. You can find this in ux0:/data/QBE
